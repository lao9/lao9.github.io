I've been interested in contributing to open source

Process for narrowing down stories:

Thought about improving issue.io UX, because I had some issues navigating it at first, but then actually found a bug that seemed doable via "Bookanook".


<h3>Step 1: Setup Environment</h3>


Then I tried following their setup instructions on their README. https://github.com/berkmancenter/bookanook

First instruction is to clone down the repo, which I followed without really thinking and forking first, which was a silly error that I had to skirt around later. Then I had to use `rvm gemset` to start setting up my project's gems, which I had never done before. I had to look up [what these were](https://rvm.io/gemsets/basics) and now know that it allows the installation of gems to be only associated with a single Ruby installation, though if anyone has strong opinions on why someone should or shouldn't use a gemset, I'd appreciate some insight because then things start going downhill...

I then tried to bundle using `bundle install` as specified in the setup and bundle wasn't an available command... so I used `gem install bundle` and **then** tried `bundle install` and it seemed to do the trick (though it did take over 5 mins to install everything.)



Many of my classmates also expressed that their open source project setups went about the same. Some couldn't even get past the setup for projects they wanted to work on, so that's something I will keep in mind as I continue to contribute or even start an open source project.

One of my first, Updated documentation to make that easier.

<h3>Step 2: Try Running Test Suite</h3>

<h3>Step 3: Report an Reproduce a Bug</h3>

The whole environment isn't actually super well made. On the whole, sort of unimpressed with the product, look, and feel of the website.

Database structure isn't normal either, user can have many roles, but the roles aren't pre-defined like an enum... you can make many different adming.

<h3>Step 4: Submit PR for a Fix</h3>
