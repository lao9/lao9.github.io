<h3>Basic Asset Pipeline & Rails Overview</h3>
<p>Oh boy, the asset pipeline. When I was first exposed to the concept, I was seriously overwhelmed... until I realized that as long as you put things in the right place and precompile, your production environment should have no issue rendering your assets.*</p>
<p>To give a very high-level overview about the asset pipeline, browsers want to do as little work to render your content as possible. Rails and other web application frameworks do their best to package your assets (typically comprised of images, stylesheets, and Javascript files) in the most optimal way possible for the browser. This has been typically accomplished in the following three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><strong>Asset concatenation.</strong> Javascript files are concatenated into a master .js file and CSS files into a master .css file. This is automatically done in Rails with the <a href="https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails">Sprockets gem</a>. Most new versions of Rails will automatically include Sprockets, so you probably won't need to add the gem manually. Concatenation significantly decreases the number of requests the browser will need to make to render your web pages.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Minification.</strong> This step simply removes whitespace and comments to make those master files <em>even smaller!!!</em></li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Coding assets with higher-level languages.</strong> CSS and Javascript files are essentially translated into Sass and CoffeeScript, respectively, which are even more compact, efficient languages that can be read by the browser.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Then ON TOP OF ALL THAT the filenames are all 'fingerprinted', which makes the names look something like this:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      application-bc58b5703ef83caa73b568842b96470925a0.js
    </code>
  </pre>
<p>The crazy string appended to the word 'application-' is a unique fingerprint for this particular file. When assets are precompiled and prepared for the production environment, it will create these fingerprinted files in your public/assets directory in Rails. The fingerprint <strong>will change</strong> when the file contents changes, thus it is always unique to the file's contents. Your browser smartly caches assets with these filenames so that it doesn't have to make requests for assets it already has. But if you <em>do</em> change an asset, it will recognize the file's name change and request, save, and render the newly changed asset. ISN'T THAT WILD!?</p>
<p>If you want more meaty info on the asset pipeline, the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">rails guides</a> for the asset pipeline are incredibly detailed.</p>
<h6>*My current experience is quite narrow and limited to heroku as the production environment... so please be warned.</h6>

<h3>Tidbits for Implementing & Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><strong>First Things First, are the assets in the right place?</strong> Just make sure images are in the 'app/assets/images' directory, css files are in the 'app/assets/stylesheets' directory, and any javascript files are in the 'app/assets/javascript' directory. Rails will take care of the rest.</p>
<p><strong>No really, are they in the right place?</strong> If you have any images that aren't loading properly, are your image urls <em>exactly</em> the same filename and extension as its corresponding asset in the 'app/assets/image' folder? When adding an image_url, it just needs to be the name of the file, like in this <a href="https://github.com/lao9/we_can_pickle_that/blob/master/db/seeds.rb">example seed file</a> from my most recent rails project. Rails knows to look in the image directory. Something else we noticed is that our heroku application didn't like .jpeg files, it liked .jpg files.</p>
<p><strong>Did you precompile?</strong> Precompiling will create and update your public assets directory, which your production environment will render from. If you did precompile, a good way to always manually force your public assets file is to first "clobber" and public assets already in there. To do so, just run the following command in your terminal (from the project root):</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    bundle exec rake assets:clobber
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Poof! No more public assets. Then precompile again:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    bundle exec rake assets:precompile
  </code>
</pre>
<p><strong>Did you push to heroku?</strong> Once your public assets are updated, you'll need to commit your changes and make sure they're pushed to heroku. A sample workflow for that is as follows:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    git add .
    git commit -m "update public assets"
    git push heroku master
  </code>
</pre>
<p><strong>Is your database up to date?</strong> If you used your seed file to populate entities with images, you may feel the need to re-seed production if you made updates to your database or seed file. Something I've needed to do <em>many times</em> is reset my production database. This can be pretty difficult due to numerous security measures around dropping your production database so use the following commands sparingly and carefully... (this is if you are using a postgres database):</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    heroku pg:reset DATABASE
    heroku run rake db:migrate db:seed
  </code>
</pre>
<p>When you try to reset, it may as for you to confirm the action using a --confirm [yourappname] tag. But hopefully this is enough information to help troubleshoot some very basic asset pipeline issues!</p>
