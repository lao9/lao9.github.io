<p>Test-Driven Development was my favorite concept learned in Mod 1. I love that TDD helps outline and guide what to code before it’s even written. It ensures that the code’s functionality is meeting the requirements that were agreed upon before code is ever written.</p>
<p>I also remember once of the best “oh crap this stuff actually works” moment was when I was working on the optional sorting suite project and came across merge sort. I challenged myself to <a href="https://github.com/lao9/sorting_suite/blob/master/test/merge_sort_test.rb" target="_blank">TDD the whole thing</a> and the result was awesome: small modular methods that worked! The whole thing didn’t take me too much time because TDD had forced me to plan out my code and work method by method. TDD required me to write in modular methods with “checkpoints” that were easy to test and confirm functionality!</p>
