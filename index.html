    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently studying backend engineering at Turing School in Denver. I’m a native Long Islander,  studied biomedical engineering at Duke in North Carolina, and then moved to New York City to work at CipherHealth, a healthcare IT startup in NYC. </p>
    <p>In my spare time, I try to enjoy the fruits of Colorado: hiking, running, biking, skiing, tasting beer, or petting a dog or cat. I love to travel (still haven’t been to South America, Oceania, or Antarctica though…) and am also trying to brush up on my Italian and Croatian. My guilty pleasures include watching The Wire, Ru Paul’s Drag Race, and looking up anything related to Pusheen.

    <h2>Turing School Mod 1 Experience</h2>
    <h3>Why Turing</h3>
    <p>I moved from New York to Denver to attend Turing. Since coding bootcamps also exist in New York City, a lot of people ask why I uprooted my entire life to attend one across the country. One reason is that Turing came recommended to me by a friend who successfully went through a bootcamp in New York. Turing’s approach is almost more than twice as long as most programs in New York and he felt that Turing’s approach was a less hectic and more effective one than a 3-month bootcamp. After attending one of the “Try Turing” weekends last October, I was also sold.</p>
    <p>Another reason I decided to come to Turing: I have known since college that I’d make a great software engineer. I programmed in MATLAB frequently for classes and in my research lab, and even I taught myself some python for my final biomedical engineering capstone project. I felt after graduating though, that I didn’t have enough experience to work as a developer. After a few years working in client management, product management, and technical support at CipherHealth, I felt it was time to go back to school to sharpen my technical skills and pursue a career to marry software engineering with biomedical engineering.</p>
    <p>Last reason I’ll list here: I was in a mental rut in New York. I had frequented Denver before Turing to visit former clients with CipherHealth. I pretty much immediately fell in love with Colorado and now that I’m here, it really is a dream come true. I’m way more active, healthy, and happier. It was just what I needed to make a pivot during my quarter-life-crisis. While I really miss my family and friends back in New York, it’s been an adventure attending school, making friends, and trying new things all by myself out here.</p>
    <h3>Mod 1 Experience</h3>
    <p>Mod 1 at Turing was a fun, positive, and productive experience for me. I felt really prepared, and kept up with the coursework. I think that my experience coding gave me an advantage, but I still held my own and challenged myself to face concepts and coursework I was completely unfamiliar with! I really enjoy the people in our class and felt like I got along with everyone. I also tried to make myself helpful and available to anyone in the class that needed a hand.</p>
    <p>I don’t think I can say that I’ve enjoyed learning anything as much as I have learning the material in Mod 1. It feels empowering to know I’m learning the skills I need to be able to create pretty much anything! My biggest challenges during Mod 1 had nothing to do with the material, they had to do with adjusting to Denver, becoming comfortable working with others (like pairing), and humbling myself to ask others for work when I’m stuck.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Technical Concept</h3>
    <p>Test-Driven Development was my favorite concept learned in Mod 1. I love that TDD helps outline and guide what to code before it’s even written. It ensures that the code’s functionality is meeting the requirements that were agreed upon before code is ever written.</p>
    <p>I also remember once of the best “oh crap this stuff actually works” moment was when I was working on the optional sorting suite project and came across merge sort. I challenged myself to <a href="https://github.com/lao9/sorting_suite/blob/master/test/merge_sort_test.rb">TDD the whole thing</a>and the result was awesome: small modular methods that worked! The whole thing didn’t take me too much time because TDD had forced me to plan out my code and work method by method. TDD required me to write in modular methods with “checkpoints” that were easy to test and confirm functionality!</p>
    <h3>Goals for Mod 2</h3>
    <p>In Mod 1, I deliberately held back on my participation with the Turing community. In the past, my type-A-ness would get the best of me. I’d be involved in too many things and not get enough out of any of it. I’d just be tired, and all the extracurriculars took away from me actually learning and excelling in class.</p>
    <p>Last mod, I was semi-involved with the Joan Clarke society, but hope to actually join a posse this mod and also work on a side project or two! I’d also like to lock down a mentor, too.</p>
