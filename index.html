    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am currently studying backend engineering at Turing School in Denver. I’m a native Long Islander,  studied biomedical engineering at Duke in North Carolina, and then moved to New York City to work at CipherHealth, a healthcare IT startup in NYC. <br>
      <br>
    In my spare time, I try to enjoy the fruits of Colorado: hiking, running, biking, skiing, tasting beer, or petting a dog or cat. I love to travel (still haven’t been to South America, Oceania, or Antarctica though…) and am also trying to brush up on my Italian and Croatian. My guilty pleasures include watching The Wire, Ru Paul’s Drag Race, and looking up anything related to Pusheen.
