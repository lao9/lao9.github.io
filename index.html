    <h2>How <em>you</em> doin'?</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Lauren. I'm a native Long Islander, food-lover, and backend engineering student at Turing School in Denver. I studied biomedical engineering at Duke in North Carolina and then moved to New York City to work at a healthcare tech startup before moving out west for Turing. </p>
    <p>In my spare time, I try to enjoy the fruits of Colorado: hiking, running, biking, skiing, tasting beer, or petting a dog or cat. I love to travel and am also trying to brush up on my Italian and learn some Croatian. My guilty pleasures include watching The Wire, Ru Paulâ€™s Drag Race, and looking up anything related to Pusheen.
