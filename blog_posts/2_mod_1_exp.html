        <h2>Mod 1 Experience</h2>
        <p>Mod 1 at Turing was a fun, positive, and productive experience for me. I felt really prepared, and kept up with the coursework. I think that my experience coding gave me an advantage, but I still held my own and challenged myself to face concepts and coursework I was completely unfamiliar with! I really enjoy the people in our class and felt like I got along with everyone. I also tried to make myself helpful and available to anyone in the class that needed a hand.</p>
        <p>I don’t think I can say that I’ve enjoyed learning anything as much as I have learning the material in Mod 1. It feels empowering to know I’m learning the skills I need to be able to create pretty much anything! My biggest challenges during Mod 1 had nothing to do with the material, they had to do with adjusting to Denver, becoming comfortable working with others (like pairing), and humbling myself to ask others for work when I’m stuck.</p>
