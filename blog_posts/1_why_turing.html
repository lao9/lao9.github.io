        <h2>Why Turing</h2>
        <p>I moved from New York to Denver to attend Turing. Since coding bootcamps also exist in New York City, a lot of people ask why I uprooted my entire life to attend one across the country. One reason is that Turing came recommended to me by a friend who successfully went through a bootcamp in New York. Turing’s approach is almost more than twice as long as most programs in New York and he felt that Turing’s approach was a less hectic and more effective one than a 3-month bootcamp. After attending one of the “Try Turing” weekends last October, I was also sold.</p>
        <p>Another reason I decided to come to Turing: I have known since college that I’d make a great software engineer. I programmed in MATLAB frequently for classes and in my research lab, and even I taught myself some python for my final biomedical engineering capstone project. I felt after graduating though, that I didn’t have enough experience to work as a developer. After a few years working in client management, product management, and technical support at CipherHealth, I felt it was time to go back to school to sharpen my technical skills and pursue a career to marry software engineering with biomedical engineering.</p>
        <p>Last reason I’ll list here: I was in a mental rut in New York. I had frequented Denver before Turing to visit former clients with CipherHealth. I pretty much immediately fell in love with Colorado and now that I’m here, it really is a dream come true. I’m way more active, healthy, and happier. It was just what I needed to make a pivot during my quarter-life-crisis. While I really miss my family and friends back in New York, it’s been an adventure attending school, making friends, and trying new things all by myself out here.</p>
